# High-Low-Number-Guessing-Game-Exercise

### Description

- This program takes the user's input of numbers and compares it to a randomly chosen numnber to see if the numbers match or not.
- This program can be used to play a number guessing game as the user has to guess the number in a certain amount of attempts to win.
- The program contains if statements in order to check the game state based on the user input, as well as a math calculation to check if the guess is within a specific range of the correct number. A counter is also implemented as the representation of the amount of guesses the user has left.
- Once the game has been completed the user can then play the game again by effectively restarting the program, or exit the game closing the program.
